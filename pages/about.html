        <h4>about me //</h4>
        <p>
          I first picked up a camera in 2010 and had so much fun taking pictures
          for my cosplayer friends (I'm a big fan of anime and manga). One day
          in 2015, my friends asked me to take photographs of their wedding, and
          I started to realise how wonderful this experience is. I witness the
          universe's grace when two loving persons getting married: the raw
          emotions of the families, the tears of joys in the bride and groom's
          eyes, the way they look at each other... I knew I wanted to
          <strong>preserve</strong>
          those precious moments.
          <br />
          <br />
          After completed my Master degree in Business at Monash University, I
          realised photography is my true calling and haven't looked back. Being
          a wedding photographer is awesome - I have the privilege to witness
          precious moments of love and tell love stories with my cameras.
          Photography has changed my everyday experience, it enables me to see
          how much beauty is all around, in the most ordinary or unexpected
          places. My clients are wonderful people who have helped me grow
          personally and professionally.
          <br />
          <br />
          What I feel most passionate is that my works help my clients
          <strong>preserve</strong> and <strong>re-live</strong> their moments.
          Eventually when the day is over, the details can be all forgotten but
          the photos will live on. My biggest goal is to create images that are
          <strong>meaningful</strong> to you - that TELL YOUR STORY, your real,
          raw emotions, something ordinary yet genuine and powerful.

            <h4>how do i work</h4>
            <p>
              I believe that a real <strong>connection</strong> between me and
              my clients is very important. I love to know my clients and what
              they are looking for, and they deserve to have their best fit whom
              they can trust and be comfortable with to photograph their big
              day. This is why I always love to sit down with my clients over a
              cup of coffee, or at least have a Skype call if distance doesn't
              allow. I will not show up on the day without getting to know about
              you two and your big day - how you have been dreaming and planning
              for it, how things will happen on that day.
              <br />
              <br />
              My clients usually refer to me as a <strong>fun</strong> and
              <strong>enthusiastic</strong> guy. I'm proud that my clients feel
              most comfortable and relaxed when working with me - on one of the
              most important/happiest days of their lives. Wedding planning and
              preparation itself is stressful already and you deserve to enjoy
              and have fun on your day, even when being photographed.
              <br />
              <br />
              Thank you for reading thus far and I'm glad that you are
              interested in my service. If you feel that I could be "your guy",
              let's
              <strong
                ><a class="about__link" href="../pages/contact.html"
                  >connect</a
                ></strong
              >
              , tell me about you two and your big day, and together we can
              share some unforgettable memories.

        <h4>CAN I GET ALL OF MY ORIGINAL PHOTOS THAT YOU TOOK?</h4>
        <p>
          YES. You will receive all the high resolution files on an USB, plus
          the design files of all the photo I edited, and when I say design
          files, I mean the photos and even your wedding album design.
        </p>
        <h4>WHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY PHOTOS?</h4>
        <p>
          Editing photos and wedding album is a process that takes time, one
          that I do not take lightly of. I do however understand how eager you
          want to see the photos and will try my best to finish everything
          within 4 -6 weeks time. However you will get a review of your photos
          within 3 days after your wedding.
        </p>
        <h4>DO YOU WORK WITH A SECOND SHOOTER?</h4>
        <p>
          It could depend on how big and complex your wedding is. The second
          photographer is available with an additional fee, let's talk and I
          will provide you with more information.
        </p>
        <h4>ARE YOU AVAILABLE TO TRAVEL?</h4>
        <p>
          Absolutely, I'm based in Melbourne but available to travel anywhere.
        </p>
